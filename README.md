# Dry Bean Classification Using Genetic Algorithm ðŸŒ±ðŸ¤–

This project uses a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** to classify dry beans based on features from the UCI **Dry Bean dataset**.

## Dataset ðŸ“Š

The dataset contains 17 features for different types of dry beans.

[Dry Bean Dataset - UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/602/dry+bean+dataset)

## Methodology ðŸ”¬

1. **Preprocessing**: Load and clean the data, then split into features and labels.
2. **Genetic Algorithm**:
   - **Selection**: Choose parents based on fitness.
   - **Crossover**: Combine genes to create offspring.
   - **Mutation**: Introduce random changes for diversity.
   - **Fitness**: Evaluate based on classification accuracy.
3. **Evaluation**: Measure the model's accuracy.

## Usage ðŸ’»

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/asalmohammadjafari/dry-bean-classification-using-genetic-algorithm.git
cd dry-bean-classification-using-genetic-algorithm
```

2. Run the Jupyter notebook to experiment with the genetic algorithm.

## Results ðŸ“ˆ

The results show the fitness of each generation and classification accuracy.
